Check_MK Plugin to check PostgreSQL Server.

    The client plugins will return a list of packages available for upgrade. It
    will seperate upgradeable packages and security upgrades, so the check
    can alert with different alerting levels. 
    
    The check will return:
    
     OK       - No upgrades are available.
     WARNING  - Only non-security upgrades are available.
     CRITICAL - Security upgrades are available (might also involve normal upgrades).
    
    The script was tested on the following Linux versions: Debian, SLES
